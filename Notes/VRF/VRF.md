Callback gas limit determines the amount of computation the oracle can do when it returns with the random words.
Getting errors, not sure why when I try to create a loop of 3 random calls.
Also, you can progrmatically create subscriptions, and add/remove consumers.
Going to do that now, add a contract as the consumer in the constructor given msg.sender
