Make sure your code is clean and well-commented. Code out here should be as neat as a pin and readable by all those who come across it.
Please respect the existing structure of the project. Your changes should seamlessly blend in.
Test your code before submitting it. Any contribution should not introduce new bugs.
Ask before you make big changes. If you've got a grand new idea, discuss it in the Issues section before diving in.
