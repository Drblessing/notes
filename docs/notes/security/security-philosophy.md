# Security Philosophy

Now, partner, listen here and listen good. When you're out here in the untamed west, you've got a mark on your back. That shiny heap of gold you've been hoarding? That's a sweet song to every outlaw and bandit in these here parts. So, how do we keep 'em off your tail? Well, I've got a few nuggets of wisdom for ya.

## Principles

1. **Don't keep all of your eggs in one basket. Prevent the worst case scenario**
2. **Security through anonymity.**
3. **The goals of security.**

## Philosophy

First off, don't put all your gold in one mine, no matter how fortified you reckon it is. You see, we ain't perfect. Slip-ups happen, no matter how careful we be. There's always a chink in the armor, always a snake in the grass. A loose nail in the vault, a wayward whisper, a hidden flaw, or a crafty thief can all spell doom for your precious hoard. So, what's the solution? Split it up. Scatter your gold in multiple hidey-holes. If some bandit stumbles upon one, you're not left with an empty hat.

Next up, keep your yap shut 'bout your gold. There's always some sidewinder eavesdroppin' in the saloon, ready to trail you to your stash. The quieter you are about your fortune, the less chance there is of some black hat findin' it. That's the second rule.

Last, but certainly not least, always remember why you're protectin' your haul. We're not just squirrelin' away gold to keep it from the bandits. We're makin' sure it's there when we need it, ensuring we can pass it down to our young'uns when we take that last ride into the sunset.

Abide by these rules, and you'll keep your gold, and more importantly, your hide, intact in this wild, wild West.
