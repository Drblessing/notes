# Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a macOS package manager that makes it easy to install and update software. We install it first to then install everything else.

We can install tools like python and applications like firefox with casks.

We install Homebrew with the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
