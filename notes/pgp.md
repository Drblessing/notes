# Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a cryptography tool that allows you to encrypt and sign data.

**Encryption:** You can encrypt a file with the public key of the recipient. The recipient can then decrypt the file with their private key.

**Signing:** You can sign a file with your private key. The recipient can then verify the signature with your public key.

PGP keys are stored in pairs: a public key and a private key. Public keys are shared with others. Private keys are kept secret.

A public key is a cryptographic key that is used for encryption, verification of digital signature, and key exchange. It is part of an asymmetric key pair, which also includes a corresponding private key. A public key is typically much longer than 256 bytes, and often represented in ASCII armor format, which includes the key material along with metadata. The size of the public key can vary depending on the specific encryption algorithm and key size used. A commonly used encryption algorithm is called RSA. For example, the RSA-based public keys used are typically represented by the modulus (N) and the public exponent (e). The size of the modulus determines the key size, and common key sizes range from 128 bytes to 512 bytes or even larger. The actual size of the public key in ASCII armor format would be larger than the raw key material due to additional metadata, such as headers and formatting. The size of the public key doesn't directly correlate with its security, the strength of the key depends on the specific encryption algorithm and key size. The ASCII armor format is a way of representing binary data, in plain text format. The binary data is encoded using ASCII characters.

A private key is the corresponding key of the public key, making a complete pair. The private key is needed to decrypt messages sent to the public key, as well as to digitally sign messages. The private key is usually stored in a secure keyring or key database maintained by the PGP software. This is because it is a secret, sensitive piece of information that must be protected. Storing it in a .txt file would be unsafe. The private key is typically encrypted with a passphrase, which acts as more protection. The size of the private key depends on the specific encryption algorithm and the key size used, just like the public key. Common key sizes for RSA range from 1024 bits to 4096 bits.

The PGP communication protocol involves multiple steps of encryption and decryption. There are also multiple cryptography algorithms packages for use with PGP. The most common algorithm used for symmetric encryption is AES, and RSA for asymmetric encryption. The first step is to encrypt the plaintext with a symmetric encryption algorithm, using a randomly generated session key. This turns the plaintext into ciphertext. The ciphertext is then encrypted with the assymetric encryption algorithm, using the public key of the recipient. The encrypted ciphertext is then sent to the recipient with the session key. The recipient decrypts the session key with their private key, then decrypts the ciphertext with the session key. This turns the ciphertext back into plaintext.

To digitally sign plaintext with a private key, the sender first creates a hash of the plaintext message. The sender then encrypts this hash with their private key. This encrypted hash forms the digital signature which is attached to the plaintext message. The signature does not conceal the message. The recipient can verify the digital signature by decrypting it with the sender's public key. They compare the calculated hash with the decrypted hash. If they match, then the message is authentic. This confirms the message integrity, and that it was sent from the sender.

Managing keys is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your data. If a key is compromised or no longer in use, it can be revoked. Key revocation alerts other user in the network that the key should no longer be used for encryption or signing purposes. This is done by creating a revocation certificate, which is then sent to a key server.

A key server is a server that stores public keys. Users can upload their public keys to a key server, and other users can download them. There are many key servers available, and some of them are connected. The most popular key server is https://keys.openpgp.org/. There is also the SKS OpenPGP Keyserver network, including servers like pgp.mit.edu and keys.gnupg.net. There's also the very useful keybase.io to find people. On websites, you can find PGP keys on the url endpoints /pgp, /pgp.text, /pgp.asc, /pgp.key, or /.well-known/keybase.txt. /.well-known/keybase.txt is used by the keybase project.

PGP fingerprints are unique identifiers for public keys. A fingerprint is generated by applying a hash function to a public key. The fingerprint is usually displayed in hex format, and 40 characters long. A fingerprint is much like an Ethereum address. You can go from a public key to a fingerprint, but not the other way around. You can use a fingerprint to verify a public key. You can also use a fingerprint to find a public key on a key server.

There are many applications for PGP. The most common use is for secure email communication. Another common use is for digitally signing documents or software distrWibutions. It can also be used for encrypting files or disk volumes.

In our increasingly digital world, PGP serves as a vital tool for maintaining privacy and anonymity. It can prevent eavesdropping, and potential attackers. This is important for protecting sensitive information, such as financial data, medical records, and personal information. Jounralists and activists use PGP to protect their sources and their work. PGP can protect you from government surveillance. It can also protect you from hackers and cybercriminals. Government agents and military personnel keeping us safe from national security threats also use PGP.

PGP is closed source, whereas GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) is open source. GPG is a free implementation of PGP. GPG is the most widely used implementation of PGP.

Here is a tutorial for using GPG: (link to the pgp.md file in the tutorial folder) [test](../Tutorials/pgp.md)

Phil Zimmerman, the creator of PGP, was investigated by the US government for violating the Arms Export Control Act. The government claimed that PGP was a munition, and that it was illegal to export it. The investigation was eventually dropped. A munition is a weapon, ammunition, or explosive. Note that a piece of computer code is being compared to a bomb.

Happy encrypting!
