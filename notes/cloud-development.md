# Cloud Development

Cloud devleopment is a part of a heartening broader trend of streaming computer resources. There is cloud gaming, cloud developoment, and soon cloud desktops. The idea that is instead of owning a computer, you can get economies of scale by renting virtual computers from large datacenters. You don't have to deal with heat, power, hardware, etc. You just plug and play.

The best option I've found for cloud development is GitHub Codespaces, though I've heard good things about GitPod.
