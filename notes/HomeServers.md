# Home Servers

Buying used servers is a great way to get a lot of computing power for cheap. They are also a great way to learn about server hardware and software. I have a few servers that I use for various purposes.

## [Dell PowerEdge R720](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/poweredge-r720/manuals)

This is a 2U rackmount server that I use as a hypervisor. It has 2 Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPUs, 128GB of RAM, and 2 1TB SSDs. It runs VirtualBox and hosts all of my other servers.

## [Dell PowerEdge R710](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/poweredge-r710/manuals)

This is a 2U rackmount server that I use as a NAS. It has 2 Intel Xeon E5620 CPUs, 64GB of RAM, and 6 2TB HDDs. It runs FreeNAS and hosts all of my media.
