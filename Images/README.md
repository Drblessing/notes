# Image Hosting on Github

For hobby projects, I use Github to host images, and really any static content, like pdfs, gifs, etc. I use the following steps to host images on Github. For now, I store my images here, then I can link to them.

Also, if you add `?raw=true` to the end of Github files on your repo, you can get a direct link to the file.

For example, the images in this repo are hosted here:

https://github.com/Drblessing/Utils/blob/master/Images/spring-cropped.jpeg

To access the direct image:

https://github.com/Drblessing/Utils/blob/master/Images/spring-cropped.jpeg?raw=true

Which gets redirected to:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drblessing/Utils/master/Images/spring-cropped.jpeg
