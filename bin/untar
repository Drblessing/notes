# Untar a file, also adds renaming functionality to avoid naming conflicts,
# and when you don't know the output name of the file.
# Usage: untar <file> <output name>

# Create a temporary directory with a whacky name to avoid naming conflicts
tmpdir="/tmp/untar0xae2d2525c-$(date +%s%N)"
mkdir "$tmpdir"

# Untar the file into the temporary directory
tar -xf "$1" -C "$tmpdir"
