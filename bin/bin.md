# Bin

I keep my user bin in `~/Github/notes/bin`.
This is where I put all my scripts and binaries that I want to be able to run from anywhere.
This directory is added to my `$PATH` in my `.zshrc` file, which is symlinked to my `~/Github/notes` repo.
Whenever I update my bin here, it gets updated on all my machines. The programs are mostly written in Bash or Python, and are mostly for personal use. The ones that use bash/zsh are configured for bash to ensure they work on all machines.
