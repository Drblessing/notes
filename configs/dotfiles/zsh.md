# ZSH

Have a little fun with the terminal!

I set my prompt to be a smile. Neigh! I also removed the username, computer name, and directory from the prompt. Simple, elegant.

To install, run the following commands:

```zsh
ln -s ~/Github/notes/configs/dotfiles/.zprofile ~/.zprofile
ln -s ~/Github/notes/configs/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/Github/notes/configs/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```
