# VSCode Keyboard Shortcuts

My philosophy is to use the keyboard as much as possible, and have the most frequently used commands use the easiest key combinations to remember.

## Most Frequently Used Commands

As a sketchpad, I use the following commands most frequently:

- Toggle Primarysidebar Visibility
- Reveal File Explorer
- Reveal Source Control

## My Cookbook

Git Sync: Cmd+G

Git Refresh: Cmd+R

He,he such great git commands and easy to remember shortcuts.

Show File Explorer: Cmd+1

Show Source Control: Cmd+2

hehe, so convenient to use the keyboard shortcuts to switch between the file explorer and source control.

Toggle Primary Sidebar: Cmd + B

The most used keyboard shortcut in my life. Essential.
