# VSCode Keyboard Shortcuts

My philosophy is to use the keyboard as much as possible, and have the most frequently used commands as the easiest key combinations.

## My Shortcuts

Git Sync: Cmd+G

Git Refresh: Cmd+R

Show File Explorer: Cmd+1

Show Source Control: Cmd+2

hehe, so convenient to use the keyboard shortcuts to switch between the file explorer and source control.

Toggle Primary Sidebar: Cmd + B

The most used keyboard shortcut in my life. Essential.

Show Extensions: Cmd + Shift + X

You only need to open this occasionally to update extensions. So I use the default shortcut.
