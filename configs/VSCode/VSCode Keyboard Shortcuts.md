# VSCode Keyboard Shortcuts

My philosophy is to use the keyboard as much as possible, and have the most frequently used commands use the easiest key combinations to remember.

## Most Frequently Used Commands

As a sketchpad, I use the following commands most frequently:

- Toggle Primarysidebar Visibility
- Reveal File Explorer
- Reveal Source Control

## My Cookbook

Git Sync: Cmd+G

Git Refresh: Cmd+R

He,he such great git commands and easy to remember shortcuts.
