# Organization

## Calendar

My main calendar is apple calendar, linked to Google Calendar so I can add events on Gcal and they appear on iCal.

## Contacts

Contacts and Birthdays are stored in Apple Contacts and synced with iCloud, appear on my calendar.

## Tasks

I like to write tasks down on paper, but I also use Notion for recurring tasks, projects, and tasks that I can't do right now but want to remember.
