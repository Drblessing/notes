# Hosting

## Python

You can hose Python projects on VPS, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Replit.
Fastapi is a good option for API's, and Flask is a good option for websites.
Docker containers are a good way to package your project, as is AWS Lambda.
You can run the Docker container on a VPS, or deploy it to AWS Lambda.
Very simple code can run on Replit.

## API

Python Fastapi can be hosted serverless on AWS Lambda or Google Cloud functions using the mangum handler.
