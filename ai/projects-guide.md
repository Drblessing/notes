# ChatGPT Projects Guide: Optimizing Your Project Directories

## Overview

ChatGPT Projects allow you to create persistent workspaces with uploaded files, custom instructions, and context that persists across conversations. Here's how to structure your project directories for optimal results.

## General Best Practices

### Essential Documents to Include:

1. **Project Overview** (`README.md`)

   - Clear project goals and objectives
   - Current progress and milestones
   - Key questions or problems to solve

2. **Custom Instructions** (`custom-instructions.md`)

   - Per-project guidance for tone, format, forbidden topics
   - Your background and expertise
   - Preferred interaction style (formal, casual, etc.)
   - Specific formats or structures you want for responses

3. **Context Documents**

   - Background information
   - Reference materials
   - Style guides or preferences

4. **Examples and Templates**
   - Sample outputs you like
   - Templates for consistent formatting
   - Previous successful work

├── recordings.mpe
├── theory-notes.md
├── practice-log.md
```

### Key Files to Include:

- **Music Profile**: Detail your instruments, skill level, favorite genres
- **Learning Goals**: Specific techniques or pieces you want to master
- **Reference Materials**: Chord charts, scale diagrams, theory guides
- **Progress Tracking**: Practice logs, recordings of your progress

## Simple Dashboard Coding Project

### Recommended Directory Structure:

```
dashboard-project/
├── README.md (project requirements, tech stack)
├── mockups.png
```

### Key Files to Include:

- **Technical Specifications**: Framework choices, API endpoints, data structures
- **Visual References**: Screenshots of similar dashboards, UI mockups
- **Code Snippets**: Working code examples, problematic sections
- **Data Samples**: Real or mock data in the format you'll use

## GRE Tutoring Project

### Recommended Directory Structure:

```
gre-tutoring/
├── README.md (target score, timeline, weak areas)

## Tips

1. **Create project readme.md**: Always start with a `README.md` that outlines:

   - Project goals
   - Key context, like equipment or software
   - Current status and next steps

2. **Custom Instructions**: Use a `custom-instructions.md` file to specify:

   - Preferred interaction style (formal, casual, etc.)

3. **Add Visual Context**: Include:

   - Screenshots of current work or ideal work
   - Diagrams of concepts
   - Charts showing progress

4. **Create Templates**: For recurring tasks, include templates like:
   - Daily practice logs
   - Code review checklists
   - Study session formats

## Example readme.md
