### Best Models

My current opinion on the best AI models (July 2025):

**OpenAI o3** is the smartest AI model available, excelling in context and up-to-date information. Where other models will suggest outdated commands, information, or facts, o3 will provide the most accurate and current information. It is particularly strong in reasoning and planning tasks. It's biggest weakness is that it is lazy and limited. I can't wait for o4!

**Claude Opus 4** is the best model for long coding and context tasks. It is the only model I've found that is not lazy. It will think for a while and produce numerous long documents, something which other model will not do.

**Overall**, I find that the reasoning and chat model are all very similar in intelligence and utility. They make similar mistakes and suggestions, and they all have their particular quirks. For coding, o3, Gemini 2.5, and Opus 4 are all good. Try each one for your task and pick the best one.

Have fun!

## Tips and Tricks

Provide the AI models as much context as possible. Take pictures, screenshots, and provide detailed descriptions of your tasks. The more information you give, the better the AI will perform.

Use workspaces and projects to organize your tasks. Then, provide documents outlining the project, goals, and any relevant information. This helps the AI understand the context and requirements.

When using AI for coding, provide clear instructions and examples. If you want the AI to generate code, specify the programming language, libraries, and frameworks you want to use.

Use the latest models available. They are constantly improving, and the latest versions will have the best performance and capabilities.

When using AI for coding, try different models for different tasks. Some models excel at certain types of code generation or debugging, while others may struggle.
