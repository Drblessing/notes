## Tips and Tricks

Provide the AI models as much context as possible. Take pictures, screenshots, and provide detailed descriptions of your tasks. The more information you give, the better the AI will perform.

Use workspaces and projects to organize your tasks. Then, provide documents outlining the project, goals, and any relevant information. This helps the AI understand the context and requirements.

When using AI for coding, provide clear instructions and examples. If you want the AI to generate code, specify the programming language, libraries, and frameworks you want to use.

When using AI for coding, try different models for different tasks. Some models excel at certain types of code generation or debugging, while others may struggle.
